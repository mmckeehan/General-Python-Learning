# My journey learning Python

## About

This public repo will hold the different projects I have done over the course of my learning journey. The end goal is to gain the skills to be able to either enhance my abilities as a IAM analyst/ engineer, or to move into the Python development space. I will include a brief description of projects as I complete them.

## Projects

### Project 1: Simple_Fight.py

This is a simple "fighting game" to learn the very basics of classes in Python.

The program starts with defining the enemy class. This will set the basics of health and shields as well as contain a function to destroy the enemy.

The "main" function is the core logic of the program. This is where the player will iterate through fights with enemies. Right now there are only two enemies.

The "fight" function is where the player will fight the enemy. This seems unfair since the enemy will not fight back (this will be implemented in a later iteration of the game). The player will do a random amount of damage (between 1 and 4).
